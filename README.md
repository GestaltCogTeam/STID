# Spatial-Temporal Identity: A Simple yet Effective Baseline for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting

Code for our CIKM'22 short paper: "[Spatial-Temporal Identity: A Simple yet Effective Baseline for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05233)".

Our code is built on [BasicTS](https://github.com/zezhishao/BasicTS), an open-source standard time series forecasting benchmark. You can also find STID in [BasicTS](https://github.com/zezhishao/BasicTS).

> Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting plays a vital role in a wide range of applications. Recently, Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have become increasingly popular MTS forecasting methods due to their state-of-the-art performance. However, recent STGNN-based methods are becoming more sophisticated with limited performance improvements. This phenomenon motivates us to explore the critical factors of MTS forecasting and design a model that is as powerful as STGNNs, but more concise and efficient. In this paper, we identify the indistinguishability of samples in both spatial and temporal dimensions as a key bottleneck, and propose a simple yet effective baseline for MTS forecasting by attaching Spatial and Temporal IDentity information (STID). STID achieves the best performance and efficiency simultaneously based on simple multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). These results suggest that by solving the indistinguishability of samples, we can design models more freely, without being limited to STGNNs.
